# GPT-team website

I would like to create a website for IT project management using AI agents. The website should allow for the creation of a project, with a project description, motivation and target users. Then I should be able to create generate a virtual AI team based on the project. Each team member should be generated with a random profile image and certain characteristics, similar to a real person. These could be preferences in terms of technologies, how conservative/risky they are when it comes to their work (experimentation, using new tech etc.) and so on.

The main project characteristics (PCs) should be fed into multiple pipelines and each sub-team or team member should pull relevant job descriptions. A product manager agent should be initially responsible for taking the PCs and creating overall tasks (epics) for each pipeline. The website should make it possible for me to have an overview of the progress of these agents and to see the deliverables they create. I should then be able to interact and prompt the engineers with further suggestions as to their work, to critique or correct the work in a feedback loop.

The website must have a concept of end users with login, with different roles - such as overseer, project manager etc. Please make suggestions as to the design of such a website.

## AI

Your website project sounds fascinating, combining project management, AI, and interactive user experience. Here are some suggestions to get you started on your design:

Homepage: A clean and easy-to-navigate homepage where new users can sign up or returning users can log in. The homepage should have brief information about the website and how it can benefit users.

Dashboard: Once logged in, the user should land on a dashboard. If the user is an overseer, the dashboard can display all the projects they are overseeing, key metrics of each project, and any notifications. If the user is a project manager, they could see the projects they are managing, and task lists with their status.

Project Creation Page: This is where the project is defined. The user enters the project description, motivation, target users, and project characteristics (PCs). This should be a simple form, perhaps with guided prompts or tooltips to help the user provide useful information.

AI Team Creation Page: Here, users can generate an AI team based on the project. The user can set preferences for each team member or let the system generate random attributes. This could be designed as a step-by-step wizard, with options for adding team members one by one or generating a whole team at once. Each member's avatar, name, and characteristics can be displayed on "cards" which can be clicked to view or edit detailed information.

Project View Page: This page is an in-depth look at an individual project. Here, users can view and interact with the AI-generated project plan, including tasks, timelines, and assigned AI team members. The layout could be similar to a Gantt chart or a Kanban board, with tasks draggable to different stages or dates. You could also include a document preview area for viewing and commenting on deliverables.

Feedback Loop System: Implement a commenting system on the Project View Page, where users can provide suggestions, critiques, or corrections. This could be done inline in the document preview area or as notes attached to tasks.

Notifications System: To keep the user engaged and informed, create a notification system that alerts the user when AI agents have made progress, when new deliverables are created, when tasks are completed, etc. These could appear on the dashboard or be sent via email, depending on user preferences.

User Management System: This is where users can see and edit their profile, set their roles, and manage their notifications.

Help and Support System: Provide tooltips and help documents throughout the site to guide users. It could be useful to have a chatbot for instant assistance.

As you design the user interface, strive for consistency in your visual language, including fonts, colors, and element styles. Prioritize usability and intuitiveness, making sure that users can easily navigate the site and understand how to use its features. Interactive elements such as buttons and links should have clear affordances.

Lastly, don't forget to implement good security practices, especially if sensitive project information will be stored on the site. User authentication, data encryption, and routine security audits are all important.

Good luck with your project!
